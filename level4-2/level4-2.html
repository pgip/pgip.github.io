      <h1>Rhapsody on a Windy Night by T.S. Eliot</h1>
      <div class="stanza1">
            <p>
                  Twelve o'clock.
                  <br>Along the reaches of the street
                  <br>Held in a lunar synthesis,
                  <br>Whispering lunar incantations
                  <br>Dissolve the floors of memory
                  <br>And all its clear relations,
                  <br>Its divisions and precisions,
                  <br>Every street lamp that I pass
                  <br>Beats like a fatalistic drum,
                  <br>And through the spaces of the dark
                  <br>Midnight shakes the memory
                  <br>As a madman shakes a dead <em>geranium</em>.
            </p>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza2">
            <p>
                  Half-past one,
                  <br>The street lamp sputtered,
                  <br>The street lamp muttered,
                  <br>The street lamp said, "Regard that woman
                  <br>Who hesitates towards you in the light of the door
                  <br>Which opens on her like a grin.
                  <br>You see the border of her dress
                  <br>Is torn and stained with sand,
                  <br>And you see the corner of her eye
                  <br>Twists like a crooked pin."
            </p>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza3">
            <p>
                  The memory throws up high and dry
                  <br>A crowd of twisted things;
                  <br>A twisted branch upon the beach
                  <br>Eaten smooth, and polished
                  <br>As if the world gave up
                  <br>The secret of its skeleton,
                  <br>Stiff and white.
                  <br>A broken spring in a factory yard,
                  <br>Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left
                  <br>Hard and curled and ready to snap.
            </p>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza4">
            <p>
                  Half-past two,
                  <br>The street lamp said,
                  <br>"Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,
                  <br>Slips out its tongue
                  <br>And devours a morsel of rancid butter."
                  <br>So the hand of a child, automatic,
                  <br>Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay.
                  <br>I could see nothing behind that child's eye.
                  <br>I have seen eyes in the street
                  <br>Trying to peer through lighted shutters,
                  <br>And a crab one afternoon in a pool,
                  <br>An old crab with barnacles on his back,
                  <br>Gripped the end of a stick which I held him.
            </p>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza5">
            <p>
                  Half-past three,
                  <br>The lamp sputtered,
                  <br>The lamp muttered in the dark.
            </p>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza6">
            <p>
                  The lamp hummed:
                  <br>"Regard the moon,
                  <br>La lune ne garde aucune rancune,
                  <br>She winks a feeble eye,
                  <br>She smiles into corners.
                  <br>She smoothes the hair of the grass.
                  <br>The moon has lost her <strong><em>memory</em></strong>.
                  <br>A washed-out smallpox cracks her face,
                  <br>Her hand twists a paper rose,
                  <br>That smells of dust and old Cologne,
                  <br>She is alone
                  <br>With all the old nocturnal smells
                  <br>That cross and cross across her brain."
                  <br>The reminiscence comes
                  <br>Of sunless dry geraniums
                  <br>And dust in crevices,
                  <br>Smells of chestnuts in the streets,
                  <br>And female smells in shuttered rooms,
                  <br>And cigarettes in corridors
                  <br>And cocktail smells in bars."
            </p>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza7">
            <p>
                  The lamp said,
                  <br>"Four o'clock,
                  <br>Here is the number on the door.
                  <br>Memory!
                  <br>You have the key,
                  <br>The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,
                  <br>Mount.
                  <br>The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall,
                  <br>Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life."
            </p>
