            <ol>
            <l1>Twelve o'clock.</l1>
            <li>Along the reaches of the street</li>
            <li>Held in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon">lunar</a> synthesis,</li>
            <li>Whispering lunar incantations</li>
            <li>Dissolve the floors of memory</li>
            <li>And all its clear relations,</li>
            <li>Its divisions and precisions,</li>
            <li>Every street lamp that I pass</li>
            <li>Beats like a fatalistic drum,</li>
            <li>And through the spaces of the dark</li>
            <li>Midnight shakes the memory</li>
            <li>As a madman shakes a dead geranium.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br><strong>Half-past one,</strong>
            <br>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_light">street lamp</a> sputtered,
            <br>The street lamp muttered,
            <br>The street lamp said, "Regard that woman
            <br>Who hesitates towards you in the light of the door
            <br>Which opens on her like a grin.
            <br>You see the border of her dress
            <br>Is torn and stained with sand,
            <br>And you see the corner of her eye
            <br>Twists like a crooked pin."
            <br>
            <em>
            <br>The <strong>memory</strong> throws up high and dry
            <br>A crowd of <strong>twisted</strong> things;
            <br>A twisted branch upon the beach
            <br>Eaten smooth, and polished
            <br>As if the world gave up
            <br>The <strong>secret</strong> of its skeleton,
            <br>Stiff and white.
            <br>A broken spring in a factory yard,
            <br>Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left
            <br>Hard and curled and ready to snap.
            </em>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br><strong>Half-past two,</strong>
            <br>The street lamp said,
            <br>"Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,
            <br>Slips out its tongue
            <br>And devours a morsel of rancid butter."
            <br>So the hand of a child, automatic,
            <br>Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay.
            <br>I could see nothing behind that child's eye.
            <br>I have seen eyes in the street
            <br>Trying to peer through lighted shutters,
            <br>And a crab one afternoon in a pool,
            <br>An old crab with barnacles on his back,
            <br>Gripped the end of a stick which I held him.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br><strong>Half-past three,</strong>
            <br>The lamp sputtered,
            <br>The lamp muttered in the dark.
            <br>
            <br>The lamp hummed:
            <br>"Regard the moon,
            <br>La lune ne garde aucune rancune,
            <br>She winks a feeble eye,
            <br>She smiles into corners.
            <br>She smoothes the hair of the grass.
            <br>The moon has lost her memory.
            <br>A washed-out smallpox cracks her face,
            <br>Her hand twists a paper rose,
            <br>That smells of dust and old Cologne,
            <br>She is alone
            <br>With all the old nocturnal smells
            <br>That cross and cross across her brain."
            <br>The reminiscence comes
            <br>Of sunless dry geraniums
            <br>And dust in crevices,
            <br>Smells of chestnuts in the streets,
            <br>And female smells in shuttered rooms,
            <br>And cigarettes in corridors
            <br>And cocktail smells in bars."
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>The lamp said,
            <br><strong>"Four o'clock,</strong>
            <br>Here is the number on the door.
            <br><strong>Memory!</strong>
            <br>You have the key,
            <br>The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,
            <br>Mount.
            <br>The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall,
            <br>Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life."
