        <p><ol><h2>Rhapsody on a Windy Night by T.S. Eliot</h2>
            <br>
                  <li>Twelve o'clock.</li>
                  <li>Along the reaches of the street</li>
                  <li>Held in a lunar synthesis,
                  <li>Whispering lunar incantations
                  <li>Dissolve the floors of memory
                  <li>And all its clear relations,
                  <li>Its divisions and precisions,
                  <li>Every street lamp that I pass
                  <li>Beats like a fatalistic drum,
                  <li>And through the spaces of the dark
                  <li>Midnight shakes the memory
                  <li>As a madman shakes a dead geranium.
                  <li>Half-past one,
                  <li>The street lamp sputtered,
                  <li>The street lamp muttered,
                  <li>The street lamp said, "Regard that woman
                  <li>Who hesitates towards you in the light of the door
                  <li>Which opens on her like a grin.
                  <li>You see the border of her dress
                  <li>Is torn and stained with sand,
                  <li>And you see the corner of her eye
                  <li>Twists like a crooked pin."
                  <li>The memory throws up high and dry
                  <li>A crowd of twisted things;
                  <li>A twisted branch upon the beach
                  <li>Eaten smooth, and polished
                  <li>As if the world gave up
                  <li>The secret of its skeleton,
                  <li>Stiff and white.
                  <li>A broken spring in a factory yard,
                  <li>Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left
                  <li>Hard and curled and ready to snap.
                  <li>Half-past two,
                  <li>The street lamp said,
                  <li>"Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,
                  <li>Slips out its tongue
                  <li>And devours a morsel of rancid butter."
                  <li>So the hand of a child, automatic,
                  <li>Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay.
                  <li>I could see nothing behind that child's eye.
                  <li>I have seen eyes in the street
                  <li>Trying to peer through lighted shutters,
                  <li>And a crab one afternoon in a pool,
                  <li>An old crab with barnacles on his back,
                  <li>Gripped the end of a stick which I held him.
                  <li>Half-past three,
                  <li>The lamp sputtered,
                  <li>The lamp muttered in the dark.
                  <li>The lamp hummed:
                  <li>"Regard the moon,
                  <li>La lune ne garde aucune rancune,
                  <li>She winks a feeble eye,
                  <li>She smiles into corners.
                  <li>She smoothes the hair of the grass.
                  <li>The moon has lost her memory.
                  <li>A washed-out smallpox cracks her face,
                  <li>Her hand twists a paper rose,
                  <li>That smells of dust and old Cologne,
                  <li>She is alone
                  <li>With all the old nocturnal smells
                  <li>That cross and cross across her brain."
                  <li>The reminiscence comes
                  <li>Of sunless dry geraniums
                  <li>And dust in crevices,
                  <li>Smells of chestnuts in the streets,
                  <li>And female smells in shuttered rooms,
                  <li>And cigarettes in corridors
                  <li>And cocktail smells in bars."
                  <li>The lamp said,
                  <li>"Four o'clock,
                  <li>Here is the number on the door.
                  <li>Memory!
                  <li>You have the key,
                  <li>he little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,
                  <li>Mount.
                  <li>The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall,
                  <li>Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life."
                  <li>The last twist of the knife.
