            <br>
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve o'clock. Along the reaches of the street held in a lunar synthesis, whispering
            <br>lunar incantations dissolve the floors of memory and all its clear relations, its divisions
            <br>and precisions, every street lamp that I pass beats like a fatalistic drum, and through the
            <br>spaces of the dark midnight shakes the memory as a madman shakes a dead geranium.
            <br>
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-past one, the street lamp sputtered, the street lamp muttered, the street lamp 
            <br>said, "Regard that woman who hesitates towards you in the light of the door which opens
            <br>on her like a grin. You see the border of her dress is torn and stained with sand, and you
            <br>see the corner of her eye twists like a crooked pin."
            <br>
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory throws up high and dry a crowd of twisted things; a twisted branch upon
            <br>the beach eaten smooth, and polished as if the world gave up the secret of its skeleton, 
            <br>stiff and white. A broken spring in a factory yard, rust that clings to the form that the
            <br>strength has left hard and curled and ready to snap.
            <br>
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-past two, the street lamp said, "Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,
            <br>slips out its tongue and devours a morsel of rancid butter." So the hand of a child, automatic,
            <br>slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay. I could see nothing behind
            <br>that child's eye. I have seen eyes in the street trying to peer through lighted shutters, and a
            <br>crab one afternoon in a pool, an old crab with barnacles on his back, gripped the end of a
            <br>stick which I held him.
            <br>
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-past three, the lamp sputtered, the lamp muttered in the dark.
            <br>
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lamp hummed: "Regard the moon, La lune ne garde aucune rancune, she winks a
            <br>feeble eye, she smiles into corners. She smoothes the hair of the grass. The moon has lost
            <br>her memory. A washed-out smallpox cracks her face, her hand twists a paper rose, that
            <br>smells of dust and old Cologne, she is alone with all the old nocturnal smells that cross
            <br>and cross across her brain." The reminiscence comes of sunless dry geraniums and dust
            <br>in crevices, smells of chestnuts in the streets, and female smells in shuttered rooms, and
            <br>cigarettes in corridors and cocktail smells in bars."
            <br>
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lamp said, "Four o'clock, here is the number on the door. Memory! You have the
            <br>key, the little lamp spreads a ring on the stair, mount. The bed is open; the tooth-brush
            <br>hangs on the wall, put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life."
            <br>
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last twist of the knife.
